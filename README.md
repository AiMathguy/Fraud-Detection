Credit-Fraud-Detection

Neural X: Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms to detect complex credit card fraud patterns.

Project Objectives

Evaluate model effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions across diverse datasets.

Identify patterns and relationships within fraudulent transaction behavior.

Develop and benchmark models for real-time fraud detection using historical transaction data, comparing results against existing ML approaches.

Design intuitive dashboards to visualize insights, research findings, and practical model results for stakeholders.

Implement robust regularization techniques to minimise overfitting and enhance predictive accuracy.

Handling Imbalanced Data:

Synthetic Minority Sampling.
Random OverSampling.
Benchmarked accuracy.

Models:

Gated Recurrent Neural Network
Multi Layer Perceptron
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
